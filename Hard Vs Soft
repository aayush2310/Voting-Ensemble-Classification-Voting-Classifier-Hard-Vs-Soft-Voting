Lets say you have two models m1 and m2 and you are working on binary classification, i.e. the output is either 0 or 1.They work in terms of probabilities.In hard voting we
count how many have 0 as the max probability and 1,then we find the frequency of the majority and tell whether it is 1 or 0.
In soft voting,we find the sum of the probabilities of all 1 and 0 and see which is more accordingly giving the final answer.Generally,the result of soft voting is better 
than hard voting.When we use soft voting,the surface becomes smooth,bcz of which we get better results sometimes.
