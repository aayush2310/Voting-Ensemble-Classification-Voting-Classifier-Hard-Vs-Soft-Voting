We have multiple algorithms called as base models.We have a dataset with which all the three are trained.Default voting type is hard.The models will be trained and they 
will be collectively used to form the classifier.The linear combination of the decision boundary of the 3 algorithms will take place.
Now,we see that the probability of the 3 algos were say 0.53,0.6 and 0.7,so the new probability of the final ensemble will be more than the maximum.
